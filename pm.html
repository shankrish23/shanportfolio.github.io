                                                <h4>Financial Analysis</h4>
												<p>I analyzed projects using financial metrics such as the discounted payback period, net present value (NPV), profitability index (PI), payback period, and internal rate of return (IRR). These techniques allowed me to assess project feasibility and make financially sound decisions.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Bridge</h4>
												<p>I created a detailed WBS bridge, breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks and sub-tasks. The WBS facilitated resource allocation, cost estimation, and efficient project execution.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Critical Path Analysis using QM Software</h4>
												<p>Using Quantitative Methods (QM) software, I performed critical path analysis to identify the most critical activities in a project, helping to schedule tasks effectively and minimize project duration.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Balance Sheet and Earned Value Analysis</h4>
												<p>I utilized balance sheets to assess a project's financial performance and identify potential financial risks. I also conducted earned value analysis to measure project progress and performance against planned costs and schedules.</p><br />


                                                
                                                <h4>Critical Ratio and S-Curve</h4>
												<p>I calculated the critical ratio to prioritize project activities based on their impact on project duration. I also created S-curves to visualize project progress over time and monitor performance.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>A-O-N Network Diagram</h4>
												<p>I constructed Activity-on-Node (A-O-N) network diagrams to depict task dependencies and facilitate critical path analysis.
                                                </p><br />
                                                <h4>Group Project on Project Management at Amma Unavagam</h4>
                                                <p>As part of a group project, my team and I managed a project at Amma Unavagam, a government-run initiative. We planned and executed the project, incorporating various project management techniques, including financial analysis, WBS, critical path analysis, earned value analysis, and network diagrams. We presented the project's progress and outcomes through a comprehensive presentation.
                                                </p><br />
                                                


                                                
												
												
												
												<h4>Outcomes</h4>

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>- Successfully managed a real-world project through effective project management methodologies and techniques.
                                                    </p>
													
													
                                                <h4>Acquire a knowledge of:</h4>	
												<p>The "Project Management" subject has equipped me with essential skills to plan, execute, and monitor projects efficiently. Through various assignments and the group project, I have honed my abilities in financial analysis, WBS development, critical path analysis, and earned value management. I am now well-prepared to tackle complex projects and ensure successful project outcomes through effective project management practices.
