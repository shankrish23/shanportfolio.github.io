                                                <h4>VaR with and without Outliers</h4>
												<p>I calculated Value at Risk (VaR) for different financial assets, considering both scenarios with and without outliers. This helped me understand the impact of extreme events on risk estimation and risk management strategies.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Risk Mitigation Strategies</h4>
												<p>I explored various risk mitigation techniques, such as diversification, hedging, and risk transfer through derivatives. I analyzed how these strategies can be used to reduce exposure to different types of financial risks.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Portfolio Risk Analysis</h4>
												<p>I conducted risk analysis on investment portfolios, considering the risk contribution of individual assets and their correlation. This analysis aided in optimizing portfolio diversification and minimizing overall risk.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Simulation and Scenario Analysis</h4>
												<p>I used simulation and scenario analysis techniques to model different risk scenarios and assess their potential impact on financial positions. This allowed me to make informed decisions in uncertain market conditions.</p><br />



                                                
                                                <h4>Commodity, Share, Interest, Forex Prices</h4>
												<p>I worked with real-world data on various financial instruments, including commodity prices, share prices, interest rates, and forex rates. Analyzing these data sets provided practical insights into financial risk assessment.
                                                </p><br />
