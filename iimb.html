												<h3>Stage 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	<h4>Introduction:</h4>
												<p>In this team project at IIMB, we aimed to classify fantasy sports games as either skill-based or chance-based. Our objective was to assess the validity of the company's claim that their games are skill-based and explore the possibility of illegal activities in the industry. We also sought to determine the level of difficulty in these games through a performance analysis of average players and experienced participants.</p><br />
												
												<h4>Classification of Fantasy Sports Games: Skill vs. Chance:</h4>
												<p>Through our analysis, we found that the outcome of fantasy sports games tends to rely heavily on speculation, which raised doubts about the claim of being purely skill-based. While some elements of skill may be present, the element of chance appeared to play a significant role, leading us to the conclusion that these games cannot be classified purely as skill-based.</p><br />
												
												<h4>Impact on Society and Government Regulation:</h4>
												<p>Our investigation highlighted that the focus of fantasy sports companies appeared to be more on financial gains rather than promoting the essence of sports. We recommend that the government implement stricter regulations to monitor these companies and prevent potential illegal activities that may arise due to the financial nature of these games.</p><br />
												
												<h4>Assessing the Difficulty Level:</h4>
												<p>To determine the skill component of fantasy sports, we conducted a test to compare the performance of an average player against that of an experienced participant. With real-time data, we carried out a predominant test to ascertain whether the fantasy sports games predominantly require skill or rely more on chance.</p><br />
												
												<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
												<p>Based on our analysis, we found that while some elements of skill may exist in fantasy sports, the influence of chance is substantial, making it challenging to classify these games as purely skill-based. Considering the financial aspect of these games, the need for stringent regulations becomes apparent to prevent any potential illegal activities. To assess the skill level further, conducting tests between average players and experienced participants with live data would be essential.</p><br />
												
												<p>Our findings emphasize the necessity for transparency and responsible practices within the fantasy sports industry, ensuring fair competition and maintaining the integrity of these games.</p><br />

												<h3>Stage 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	<h4>Objective:</h4>
												<p>The primary goal of the datathon was to improve the conversion rate of Champo Carpets from 20% to 35% or better. To achieve this, we focused on identifying the target customers, identifying potential customers, and providing insights to increase revenue and enhance overall business performance.</p><br />
												
												<h4>Data and Tools Used:</h4>
												<p>We utilized 4 years of raw, sample, and order conversion data provided by Champo Carpets for our analysis. To conduct the analysis, we employed various tools, including Python, R programming language, Microsoft Excel, SPSS, Power BI, and Tableau.
												</p><br />
												
												<h4>Work Done:</h4>
												<h5>Basic Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h5>
												<p>We began by cleaning the data and then performed EDA to gain initial insights into the dataset.
												</p><br />
												<h5>Feature Engineering and Descriptive Statistics:</h5>
												<p>We carried out feature engineering to create relevant features for the analysis. Descriptive statistics helped us understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
												</p><br />
												<h5>Clustering and Hypothesis Testing:</h5>
												<p>We employed clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior. Hypothesis testing was conducted to validate our assumptions and draw meaningful conclusions.
												</p><br />
												<h5>Decision Tree and Random Forest:</h5>
												<p>To predict customer behavior and potential conversions, we utilized decision tree and random forest algorithms.
												</p><br />
												<h4>Main Results and Insights</h4>
												<p> <p>- The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92.13%, indicating the reliability of our predictions.</p>
													<p>- We observed a correlation between the order category and order sample through the CHI SQUARE test.</p>
													<p>- The number of orders increased from 2017 to 2018 but decreased in 2019, while the number of samples almost tripled from 2018 to 2019.</p>
													<p>- "Hand Tufted" carpet type contributed the highest revenue, followed by "Durry," while "Gun Tufted" had the lowest sales.</p>
													<p>- The top 20 out of 37 customers were major contributors to the revenue.</p>
													<p>- "Durry" type carpets had the highest number of units sold but ranked second in terms of revenue, indicating that "Hand Tufted" carpets were premium and generated higher revenue despite lower sales.</p>
													<p>- The USA and the UK were the top sales regions, with other countries like Romania, Australia, India, Canada, and South Africa also contributing significantly to revenue.</p>
													<p>- Carpets with a rectangle shape were the most popular, while the square shape had the best conversion rate despite the smallest share.</p>
													</p><br />
												
												<h4>Challenges Faced:</h4>
												<p>Throughout the analysis, we encountered challenges in data cleaning, model selection, and interpreting results. Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our findings was a constant concern.</p><br />
												<h4>Recommendations and Conclusion:</h4>
												<p>Based on our insights, we propose the following recommendations to increase the order conversion rate for Champo Carpets:
													<p>- Forecast and design products that match customer requirements to drive conversions.</p>
													<p>- Leverage the impact of digital marketing in this digital era to attract potential buyers.</p>
													<p>- Focus on high conversion regions for increased promotion and sales.</p>
													<p>- Identify and promote items with high conversion rates in each geography.</p>
													</p><br />

												<p>
													In conclusion, by implementing the above recommendations and suggestions, we believe Champo Carpets has a good chance to achieve the desired increase in the order conversion rate and improve its overall business performance.
