								<p>In the "Time Series Analysis and Forecasting" subject, I delved into the fascinating world of time-dependent data and learned various techniques to analyze and forecast time series data.
                                    <br />
									Through hands-on assignments, I explored concepts like differencing, autocorrelation, ARMA and ARIMA models, cointegration, and vector autoregression.

                                                <h4>Time Series Data Preparation</h4>
												<p>I began by preparing the time series data, converting it into a suitable format for analysis. I explored lag differences, including 1st and 2nd differences, to stabilize and stationarize the series. I also calculated returns and visualized the data graphically.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis</h4>
												<p>I computed the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to identify the correlation between data points at different time lags. This helped in determining the order of the AR and MA components in ARMA and ARIMA models.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>ADF Test and Stationarity Check</h4>
												<p>I performed the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity in the time series data. A stationary series is essential for accurate forecasting.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>ARMA and ARIMA Model Building</h4>
												<p>I constructed ARMA and ARIMA models based on the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis. These models helped in understanding the time series behavior and predicting future values.</p>


                                                
                                                <h4>Automatic ARIMA Forecasting</h4>
												<p>I explored the concept of automatic ARIMA forecasting, allowing the software to determine the best ARIMA model for the time series data.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Actual and Forecast Graphs</h4>
												<p>I visualized the actual and forecasted values using graphs to compare the model's accuracy in predicting future values.
                                                </p><br />
                                                <h4>Residual Analysis and Table</h4>
                                                <p>I conducted residual analysis to assess the model's goodness of fit. I also created tables to summarize the model's performance metrics.
                                                </p><br />
                                                <h4>Forecast Comparison and AIC Graph</h4>
                                                <p>I compared different forecasting models and evaluated their performance using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). I visualized the AIC graph to identify the best-fitted model.
                                                </p><br />
                                                <h4>Johansen's Cointegration Test and VECM/VAR Model</h4>
                                                <p>I explored the concept of cointegration using Johansen's test, which assesses the long-term equilibrium relationship between multiple time series. I then applied the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) or Vector Autoregression (VAR) model for forecasting multiple variables.
                                                </p><br />
