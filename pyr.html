												<h3>Assignments</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	<h4>Basic Mathematical Calculations using Python and R</h4>
												<p>For this assignment, I utilized Python in Jupyter Notebook and R in R Studio to perform fundamental mathematical calculations. I implemented arithmetic operations, handled variables, and practiced coding syntax in both languages. This assignment served as an excellent foundation for further exploration.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics in R</h4>
												<p>In this assignment, I delved into the world of statistics using R and relevant libraries. I applied descriptive statistics to summarize and analyze data, gaining insights into the central tendencies and distributions of various datasets. Moreover, I explored inferential statistics to draw conclusions and make predictions based on sample data.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning with Cardheko Dataset</h4>
												<p>In this hands-on project, I worked with the Cardheko dataset to preprocess the data, remove outliers, and build machine learning models. I employed Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn to handle data manipulation and utilized visualization tools to gain insights into the data patterns. Additionally, I implemented regression and classification algorithms to predict car prices and evaluate model performance.
                                                </p><br />
												
												<h4>IPL Dataset Analysis for Valuable Insights</h4>
												<p>In this intriguing assignment, I leveraged the IPL dataset to derive valuable insights from the cricketing world. I employed Python and relevant libraries to explore player performances, team statistics, and match outcomes. Through data visualization, I uncovered trends and patterns that provided a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics.
                                                </p><br />
